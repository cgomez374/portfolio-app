                    My professional experience is lacking but I make that up with my positive and hungry mindset to help others reach their dreams. 
                    I have 5+ years of working closely with individuals in a sales environment and my technical skills include the basics and advance tools to create web pages. 
                    Front-end development is only the start, I'm always looking to learn new skills and move into more complex projects.
